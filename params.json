I tried to simulate a simple DJ console. It can change frequency and the delay of sound. It can be also controlled by photoresistor by changing the amount of light around it. Bellow you can see basic arduino uno wiring.\r\n\r\n![wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bullcode/DJconsole/gh-pages/images/consolewiring.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
